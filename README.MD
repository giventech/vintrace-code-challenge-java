# How to Run

This is a step-by-step guide how to run the example:

## Installation

* The example is implemented in Java 8. See    https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml . The
   examples need to be compiled so you need to install a JDK (Java    Development Kit). A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is not
   sufficient. After the installation you should be able to execute   `java` and `javac` on the command line.
    It also need maven install to be able to run the build phase
   
## Build

Change to the directory `vintrace-code-challenge-java` and run `mvn clean package` 
 (Windows). This

## Run 
------
    java -cp target/exerciseone-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar devproblem.WineTest
